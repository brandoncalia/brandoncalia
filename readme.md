# :game_die: Brandon Calia - Data Science & Mathematics

### :8ball: About me

Welcome! I'm Brandon, an aspiring data scientist currently studying applied math and computer science at Temple University. Being fascinated by math since my sophomore year of high school, I quickly took up an interest in data science/machine learning problems in college. I joined two research teams at the university to sharpen my skills, one in computational neuroscience and another in ranked choice voting. 

### :gem: Projects

Take a look at some of my [work](https://github.com/brandoncalia/Ranked-Pref-Sim) with ranked preference elections. A good mix of math, data science, and political science, the research (advised by Temple's mathematics department) aims to test the viability of ranked choice elections by simulating them based on data gathered from real ballots.

Another fun one, [PiTunes](https://github.com/brandoncalia/PiTunes) originally started as a way to teach myself SQL database management, but ended with a good lesson in GUI design, API integration, and data collection. The project is a Raspberry Pi interface that displays data on a user's Spotify listening habits.
